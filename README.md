#Kaprekar Number
A little JS function that works out if something is a kaprekar number. 


A kaprekar number is In mathematics, a Kaprekar number for a given base is a non-negative integer, the representation of whose square in that base can be split into two parts that add up to the original number again.  
For instance, 45 is a Kaprekar number, because 452 = 2025 and 20 + 25 = 45. The Kaprekar numbers are named after D. R. Kaprekar.
