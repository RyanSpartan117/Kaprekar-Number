# Kaprekar Number
A little JS function that works out all the Kaprekar numbers between a given range.

In mathematics, a Kaprekar number for a given base is a non-negative integer, the representation of whose square in that base can be split into two parts that add up to the original number again.  

For instance, 45 is a Kaprekar number, because 452 = 2025 and 20 + 25 = 45. The Kaprekar numbers are named after D. R. Kaprekar.  

This tool only works in the developer console. Once you have the console open and use the function findKaprekarNumbers function and give it a start and end range:  

```findKaprekarNumbers(1, 100)```  

Will give you back an array.
